                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p class="resume-intro">&emsp;&emsp;As an analyst/developer with 3 years of experience using Python and Pandas, as
                    well as SQL, advanced Excel, and VBA skills, I am well-equipped to handle any data
                    manipulation and analysis tasks. In addition, my strong 
                    background in mathematics have given me a solid foundation in data management
                    and analysis. Furthermore, I have some machine learning experience from my
                    college studies, which has given me a taste of the potential for data to be
                    used for predictive modeling and other advanced analytics techniques. I am
                    excited to bring my skills and experience to an engineering role and
                    contribute to the development and maintenance of robust data pipelines.

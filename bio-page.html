                <p class="summary">&emsp;&emsp;My name is Joseph, and I am a software developer and
                      analyst with three years of professional 
                      experience. My interests include skateboarding, 
                      video games, mathematics, reading, and traveling
                       (I am also quite fond of my dog). I am the first 
                      in my family to attend college, where I received a 
                      BS in Mathematics. During this time, I developed 
                      an interest in programming through my final year of machine learning courses. 
                        Since then, I have continued to 
                      expand my knowledge and have found the process of
                       learning and implementing what I have learned to
                        be very enjoyable.</p>
                        <p class="summary">&emsp;&emsp;My career goals are to seek out challenges and 
                            opportunities that push me out of my comfort 
                            zone. I am passionate about learning and can often be found
                             reading articles or watching videos on database architecture, cryptography,
                              math topics, and blockchain technology. My primary professional focus 
                              is to dive deeper into the data engineering lifecycle whether
                              it be using traditional methods or in the Web3 space. I find 
                              the topic of database architecture to be fascinating and exciting 
                              as it continues to evolve and there is always
                               more to learn about it. This is what originally drove my passion 
                               for programming and mathematics as well, as there is an
                                abundance of knowledge to explore and even if 
                                one chooses a specific direction, there is 
                                always more to discover.</p>
                        <p class="summary">&emsp;&emsp;Thank you for visiting my 
                        site. If you have any questions or would like assistance
